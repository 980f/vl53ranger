    <p>VL53 API</p>
    <p>as reworked by 980F, but pretty close to the original C code<br>
      starting with Adafruit gentle rewrite.</p>

    <p>During the migration it has become obvious that no one has done any rigorous testing with actual communications errors. The honoring of the errors was erratic often using a value that was not successfully fetched.<br>
      The having an error flag that is repeatedly assigned to be successive operations and then is tested before almost all of the subsequent ones makes it easy to screw up the checking.</p>
    <p>The use of error code returns from layers where all the errors are of a single type is tedious.</p>
    <p>I have tried to both hide some of the mess, but also check errors rigorously via a class which binds the error state to the associated value. One could then choose to do a few operations then check the values for "being Ok" before using them.<br>
      <br>
      I note that someone did Error |= Error, if that had been done with a double || then the subsequent items would not execute. That retains the first Error. For the |= to make sense one has to know that only two values will be returned- the actual Error and the 'no error' values where the 'no error' must be zero.</p>
    <p>I am guessing that 'thread_local' doesn't work in windows dlls, else a thread local error code and a boolean return would be far simpler than the present stuff.</p>
    <p>Note: making all functions return Error codes even when errors are not possible and a value is being returned via a pointer is a bad architectural decision. In C++ it is even more a bad idea since it is easy to return a paired value and status.</p>
    <p><br>
      The shared error type across even deep layers is an unnecessary tangling of scope. I think I may have sorted out the worst of that, with the lowest layers returning booleans for success/failure, intermediate layers convert that to the Error code known by that layer.</p>
    <p>After a few more thousand lines of code I think that all of the fancy footwork needed to make sense out of the ubiquitous-even-when-senseless Error values is to have a member on the object. It does not seem possible to have multiple threads successfully calling these functions. If an ISR hits a runtime issue (versus a will-always-fail bad parameter issue) then it has likely messed up any foreground actions in progress. One has to have some sort of lock when doing multiple operations, and that would lead to deadlocks if anything significant were done in an isr.<br>
      <br>
      That is all certainly the case in microcontrollers such as the cortex-M3 where the by far safest thing to do is to have a loop which sleeps until interrupt then checks flags set by ISR's to invoke any significant behavior. Any blocking of higher level operations can be implemented by leaving the "need service" bit set when some other statemachine has locked access for itself.<br>
      Using some form of yield() when doing blocking operations is begging to have recursive calls that create their own type of complication.<br>
      <br>
      Any operation that can take enough time to interfere with other operations unrelated to it needs to be programmed via a state machine, not via using the program counter (instruction pointer for you x86 types) as a state variable. The process of building such a state machine often leads to greater understanding of the process itself so is pedagogical on top of kicking out things that are likely to freeze the whole system.</p>
    <hr>The nominal layering implied by file names of core, api, and calibration were horribly tangled. All 3 implementation files called methods in the other files.<br>
    <br>
    It appears that the intent was to create what is done in C++ with protected/private members of a class. The api listed the functions that are public, the other two those that are private.<br>
    I started moving methods around the 3 classes in a hierarchy before discovering the futility of that. There is still a split of implementation files, to keep them smaller. <br>
    There are two classes Core and Api which derives from Core, and Core might go away. I expect that having sibling chips at hand might elucidate what Core should be, focussed on data present where Api would have procedures.<br>
